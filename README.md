# Deck Creator - Balatro Custom Deck Creation Tool

## Introduction

Deck Creator is a small tool for the game Balatro that allows users to create, save, load, and even share custom decks. Currently only some basic options are provided, but future updates should add more functionality. I'm open to suggestions and contributions!

## Requirements

Requires Steamodded v0.6.2+

## How to Use

- Load up modded Balatro (see [Steamodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded))
- Click on the "Mods" button on the main menu
- Click on "Deck Creator" by Nyoxide
- Click on "Create Deck"
- Choose all the options you would like. Options that are not changed will be defaulted to the normal default game options.
- Head back to the "General" tab when you're done, and click "Save Deck"
- The deck will be saved to a file called "CustomDecks.txt" under this mod's folder in another subdirectory. 
- If you would like to share your deck list with anyone, all they need to do is copy and paste your CustomDecks.txt file and place it into the folder in their Mods directory. This mod will detect all .txt files in there and merge all the deck lists together and load all decks into the game.
